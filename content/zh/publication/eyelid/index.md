abstract: Blind or low vision (BLV) people were recently reported to be live streamers on the online platforms that employed content curation algorithms. Recent research uncovered perceived algorithmic biases suppressing the content created by marginalized populations (e.g., people of color, the LGBT+ community, and content creators of lower socioeconomic status). However, little is known about how BLV streamers, as a marginalized population , perceive the effects of the algorithms adopted by live streaming platforms. We interviewed BLV streamers (N=19) of Douyin — a popular live stream platform in China — to understand their perceptions of algorithms, perceived challenges, and mitigation strategies. Our findings show the perceived factors contributing to disadvantages under algorithmic evaluation of BLV streamers’ content (e.g., issues with filming and timely interaction with viewers) and perceived algorithmic suppression (e.g., content not amplified to sighted users but suppressed within the BLV community). Their mitigation strategies (e.g., not watching other BLV streamers’ shows) tended to be passive. We discuss design considerations to design a more inclusive and fair live streaming platform.
