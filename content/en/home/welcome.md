<strong>Augmenting People by Empowering X (perception, mobility, cognition, social and emotional needs)</strong>

AI and computing technologies have been changing people’s lives at unprecedented speed. It is important to “get the right design” and “get the design right” when designing AI- and computing-powered systems that humans ultimately use so that everyone can benefit from computing.  

Led by [Prof. Mingming Fan](https://www.mingmingfan.com/), APEX group conducts research at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), AI and VR/AR/MR with three foci: 

- **Assistive Technology (AT):** to empower older adults and people with disabilities 

- **Human-AI Collaboration:** to understand human-AI collaboration dynamics via scientific studies and to create novel human-AI collaboration systems. 

- **VR/AR/MR:** to create novel VR/AR/MR interaction techniques and applications, for aging, accessibility and learning/education purposes.

Our group’s work has been published at top-tier venues of human-computer interaction (HCI). We have won Best Paper Honorable Mention Awards (4 times) and Best Paper Award from ACM CHI, Best Paper Honorable Mention Awards from UbiComp, Best Artifact Awad from ACM ASSETS, and Best Paper Honorable Mention Awards from Chinese CHI (2 times).
