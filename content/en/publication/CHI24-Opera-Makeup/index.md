abstract: Chinese traditional opera (Xiqu) performers often experience skin problems due to the long-term use of heavy-metal-laden face paints. To explore the current skincare challenges encountered by Xiqu performers, we conducted an online survey (N=136) and semi-structured interviews (N=15) as a formative study. We found that incomplete makeup removal is the leading cause of human-induced skin problems, especially the difficulty in removing eye makeup. Therefore, we proposed EyeVis, a prototype that can visualize the residual eye makeup and record the time make-up was worn by Xiqu performers. We conducted a 7-day deployment study (N=12) to evaluate EyeVis. Results indicate that EyeVis helps to increase Xiqu performers' awareness about removing makeup, as well as boosting their confidence and security in skincare. Overall, this work also provides implications for studying the work of people who wear makeup on a daily basis, and helps to promote and preserve the intangible cultural heritage of practitioners.
