abstract: Companion robots hold immense potential in providing emotional support to older adults in the rapidly aging world. However, questions have been raised regarding whether having a robotic companion benefits healthy older adults, how they perceive the value of companion robots, and what their relationship with companion robots would be like. To understand healthy older adults' perceptions, attitudes, and relationships toward companion robots, we conducted multiple focus groups with eighteen retirees. Our findings underscore the social context encountered by older adults in China and reveal the mismatch between the current value proposition of companion robots and healthy older adults' needs. We further identify factors influencing the adoption of robotic companionship, which include individuals' self-disclosure tendencies, quality of companionship, differentiated value, and seamless collaboration with aging-in-community infrastructure and services.
