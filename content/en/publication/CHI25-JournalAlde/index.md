abstract: Digital journaling offers a means for older adults to express themselves, document their lives, and engage in self-reflection, contributing to the maintenance of cognitive function and social connectivity. Although previous works have investigated the motivations and benefits of digital journaling for older adults, little technical support has been designed to offer assistance. We conducted a formative study with older adults and uncovered their encountered challenges and preferences for technical support. Informed by the findings, we designed a Large Language Model (LLM) empowered tool, JournalAIde, which provides vicarious experience, idea organization, sample text generation, and visual editing cues to enhance older adults’ confidence, writing ability, and sustained attention during digital journaling. Through a between-subjects study and a field deployment, we demonstrated the JournalAIde’s significant effectiveness compared to a baseline system in empowering older adults in digital journaling. We further investigated older adults’ experiences and perceptions of LLM writing assistance.
