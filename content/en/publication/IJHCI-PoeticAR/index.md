abstract: As a famed Chinese classical garden, the Jichang Garden was a constant inspiration to many poets in its hundreds of years’ history, who composed a rich body of poems—a valuable intangible cultural heritage. While tourists tend to pay attention to tangible natural scenery and historical architectures, they often neglect intangible cultural heritage—poems. We interviewed 23 tourists and found that augmented reality (AR) was viable for tourists to enjoy the physical scenery and the poetry simultaneously. We developed an initial prototype of PoeticAR, which presents poems based on physical scenery to enhance tourists’ cultural and aesthetic experience. We further revised the prototype based on the ideas generated from a workshop with 18 tourists. We conducted a between-subject user study with 30 tourists to compare PoeticAR with Video. Results showed that PoeticAR significantly motivated tourists’ interest in poems, enhanced the cultural and aesthetic tour experience in Jichang Garden, and increased awareness of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Cultural Heritage sites.
