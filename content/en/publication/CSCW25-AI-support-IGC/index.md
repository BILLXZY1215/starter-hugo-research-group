abstract: Inter-generational communication is essential for bridging generational gaps and fostering mutual understanding. However, maintaining it is complex due to cultural, communicative, and geographical differences. Recent research indicated that while Virtual Reality (VR) creates a relaxed atmosphere and promotes companionship, it inadequately addresses the complexities of inter-generational dialogue, including variations in values and relational dynamics. To address this gap, we explored the opportunities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in supporting inter-generational communication in VR. We developed three technology probes (e.g., Content Generator, Communication Facilitator, and Info Assistant) in VR and employed them in a probe-based participatory design study with twelve inter-generational pairs. Our results show that AI-powered VR facilitates inter-generational communication by enhancing mutual understanding, fostering conversation fluency, and promoting active participation. We also introduce several challenges when using AI-powered VR in supporting inter-generational communication and derive design implications for future VR platforms, aiming to improve inter-generational communication.
