abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) tools have gradually been integrated into the daily workflow of UX practitioners. While existing research has explored the integration of AIGC tools in daily workflow, little is known about their impact on social dynamics within UX collaboration. We conducted four focus groups and eight semi-structured interviews with 26 UX practitioners to investigate how AIGC tools influence social dynamics in UX collaboration. Our findings indicated that AIGC tools not only mitigated conflicts but also introduced potential new conflicts. AIGC tools expanded the roles of UX practitioners and fostered a team culture characterized by exploring and discussing. Participants have higher expectations for AI-assisted design in user understanding and prototype evaluation, and team-motivated AI tools learning. Based on these findings, we discussed the benefits and concerns of conflict resolution through AIGC and the importance of teams in AI learning. Finally, we proposed several suggestions for future AI design research.
