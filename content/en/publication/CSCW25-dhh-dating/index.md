abstract: People who are deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) in China are increasingly exploring online platforms to connect with potential partners. This research explores the online dating experiences of DHH communities in China, an area that has not been extensively researched. We interviewed sixteen participants who have varying levels of hearing ability and love-seeking statuses to understand how they manage their identities and communicate with potential partners online. We find that DHH individuals made great efforts to navigate the rich modality features to seek love online. Participants used both algorithm-based dating apps and communitybased platforms like forums and WeChat to facilitate initial encounters through text-based functions that minimized the need for auditory interaction, thus fostering a more equitable starting point. Communitybased platforms were found to facilitate more in-depth communication and excelled in fostering trust and authenticity, providing a more secure environment for genuine relationships. Design recommendations are proposed to enhance the accessibility and inclusiveness of online dating platforms for DHH individuals in China. This research sheds light on the benefits and challenges of online dating for DHH individuals in China and provides guidance for platform developers and researchers to enhance user experience in this area
