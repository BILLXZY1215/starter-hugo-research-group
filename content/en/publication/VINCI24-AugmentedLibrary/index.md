abstract: Despite the rise of digital libraries and online reading platforms, physical libraries still offer unique benefits for education and community engagement. However, due to the convenience of digital resources, physical library visits, especially by college students, have declined. This underscores the need to better engage these users. Augmented Reality (AR) could potentially bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. In this paper, we present Augmented Library, an HMD-based AR system designed to revitalize the physical library experience. By creating interactive features that enhance book discovery, encourage community engagement, and cater to diverse user needs, Augmented Library combines digital convenience with physical librariesâ€™ rich experiences. This paper discusses the development of the system and preliminary user feedback on its impact on student engagement in physical libraries.
